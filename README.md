## Problem Statement

- **PSID:** KVH-009
- **Problem Statement Title:** Advanced CCTV analytics solution
- **Team Name:** Suraksha Drishti Kavach
- **Team Leader Name:** Hrushikesh Kachgunde
- **Institute Code (AISHE):** 6802
- **Institute Name:** Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Engineering, Management and Research

## Solution Overview

Our project, **Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution**, aims to automatically detect incidents related to any crime using live CCTV feeds. We deploy cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning algorithms for object detection and classification. Anomaly detection is achieved through LSTM Autoencoder and One Class SVM algorithms. Alerts are generated in real-time to the nearest police station, accompanied by detailed incident reports.

## Technology Stack

- **Language & Frameworks:** Python, Tensorflow, PyTorch
- **Computer Vision Libraries:** OpenCV, Pillow
- **Object Detection Algorithm:** YOLOv8
- **Anomaly Detection Algorithm:** LSTM Autoencoder, One Class SVM
- **Database Management System:** SQL & NoSQL Databases
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Hosting and Cloud:** Amazon Web Services (AWS)

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this project is to automatically detect incidents related to any crime using live CCTV feeds. Additional objectives include:

- Real-time alert generation to the nearest police station
- Creation of detailed incident reports for each detected incident
- Utilization of deep learning algorithms for object detection and classification
- Anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder and One Class SVM
- User-friendly interface for police to view real-time analytics, reports, and alerts
- Maintenance of a comprehensive database for future reference

## Features

- Live incident detection through YOLOv8 object detection
- Anomaly detection using LSTM Autoencoder and One Class SVM
- Real-time alerts and incident reports
- User-friendly police interface
- Database for storing crime-related data
- Cloud deployment on AWS for scalability and accessibility
