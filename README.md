## Problem Statement

- **PSID:** KVH-009
- **Problem Statement Title:** Advanced CCTV analytics solution
- **Team Name:** Suraksha Drishti Kavach
- **Team Leader Name:** Hrushikesh Kachgunde
- **Institute Code (AISHE):** 6802
- **Institute Name:** Dr. D. Y. Patil Institute of Engineering, Management and Research

## Solution Overview

Our project, **Advanced CCTV Analytics Solution**, aims to automatically detect incidents related to any crime using live CCTV feeds. We deploy cutting-edge computer vision and deep learning algorithms for object detection and classification. Anomaly detection is achieved through LSTM Autoencoder and One Class SVM algorithms. Alerts are generated in real-time to the nearest police station, accompanied by detailed incident reports.
